<img src="{{ site.url }}/static/img/about/me.jpg" alt="A photo of me." width="300px" style="padding: 0; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px; float: left">üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Sean! I‚Äôm a software developer from Tacloban City, Philippines with a CS degree from the University of the Philippines Tacloban College.

üöÄ I'm a passionate and versatile software developer who has been programming for 10+ years, with around 2 years of those as a professional. I've worked with different tech and built apps for the desktop, web, and mobile. I have some experience dealing with clients, and I have taught programming. I am currently co-leading a local developer community. I'm looking forward to moving towards app development, game dev, and graphics dev from web dev.

‚ö° I consider Rust, Python, and C++ as my main tech stack. However, I've already worked, to different degrees, with Java, Go, C, HTML/CSS, C#, JavaScript, Bash, PowerShell, SQL, SDL2, Dear ImGui, Qt, WinUI 3, Jinja, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, InnoSetup, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, Win32 API, TensorFlow, and Jupyter. I've also dabbled with Dart, Flutter, egui, OpenGL, KMM, Vulkan, and MQTT.

üíª For many years, especially during my high school and college days, I would have only preferred working in a Linux environment, particularly Ubuntu or any Ubuntu-based distro. However, recently perhaps due to maturity, I've made the decision to work in Windows. I may be a developer by trade. But, I also do art, some video editing, graphics design, and gaming. I believe Windows is the one that lets me do that well without much temporal and financial cost, at the time, until I am able to purchase a Mac. So, I eventually learned how to develop in a Windows environment as well.

üó£Ô∏è I also speak _human_ languages. I'm not a caveman that just goes with unga-bunga. Haha. I can speak Waray/Binisaya, English, Filipino, and some Bisaya (I would use some English words to fill up parts of Bisaya that I don't know, but please continue speaking in Bisaya whenever I speak Bisaya to you too. I'm trying to learn.). As for writing, I do tend to write more in English.

<p class="text-center"><em>Post-event photo ops during Dev8 Tech Talks held last February 18, 2023.</em></p>

ü´° Volunteering is also a part of me. I'm currently co-leading a local developer community in my area called [Dev8](https://facebook.com/dev8community), which I also co-founded. Through Dev8, we want to improve the advance the tech scene of our region, Eastern Visayas. We've already hosted two conferences, Google I/O Extended Leyte 2019 (August 17, 2019) and our own Dev8 Tech Talks (February 18, 2023). We also regularly hold meetups once a month, and we have a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2pVU8Gb6iDwmCiD3vACw3u?si=10aa6ba8181f48c3) where we release episodes once a month. I do a lot for Dev8, but I also help out [outside of Dev8](/works).
