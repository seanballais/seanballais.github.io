Hi! I’m Sean and I hack code. I hack code in C/C++, C#, Python, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. There, satisfied? Clearly, no. It’s too brief for an About page. So, I’ll elaborate more.

![A picture of me](/static/img/me.jpg "One of the rare times I have to wear formally/")

First of all, my full name is Sean Francis N. Ballais. My friends usually call me ‘Sean.’ I went out of my mother’s womb on May 15, 1999, and I currently reside in Tacloban City, Philippines (Yes, the one that was hit by Super Typhoon Haiyan way back in November 8, 2013. But that’s another story for a another blog post). I’m an alumni (Batch 2015) of Philippine Science High School Eastern Visayas Campus. I’m currently enrolled in University of the Philippines Visayas Tacloban College.

As mentioned before, I am a code hacker, better known as a (hobbyist) programmer. I have experience programming in C/C++, Python, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. But I have dabbled with Visual Basic (including the .Net version), C#, BASIC-256, Perl, PHP, and Ruby before. When I'm programming, you'll usually see me with Sublime Text, a terminal window, Geary, Firefox (or Chrome depending on the situation) and XChat opened because that's how I program. I also have Nemiver opened in certain occasions. When I have the time, I might learn Haskell, Go, and Node.JS just to add something to my toolbox. If you have additional technologies you want me to try and learn, just email them to me or comment them below. I’ll appreciate it.

In the field of Computer Science, I am interested in computer graphics, computer vision, artificial intelligence, UI/UX design, web development, human-to-human and human-to-computer interactions, and networking.

Whenever I’m working on a software project, I usually prefer to develop the logical/backend side more than developing the frontend because I find developing the backend more fun. However, I would, at times, hack into the frontend because I need to link it to the backend or to fix some issue in it.

As with many other programmers, I am also political in terms of operating system preference. Honestly, I prefer working with a UNIX-based system, most notably Linux or OS X, than working with a Windows machine. Windows just doesn’t give me enough power and flexibility in my opinion. It was a different case way back around early 2011 that I find programming in Windows easier and more preferable. I also advocate the use of open source technologies, because open source is awesome.

Currently, I’m creating a 2D game with my cousins using a custom-made game engine (why not?). It’s still in its early stages and in pre-production.

Whenever I’m not coding, I would sometimes be seen playing sports and hanging out with friends; reading books or online articles of any topic that may interest me (IFLS, CommitStrip, Phoronix, PCWorld, and Reddit, anyone?); creating art with GIMP and Blender 3D; listening to podcasts; taking pictures; blogging; keeping up with the latest news; 'hacking' technology; or just pondering ideas for the future.

If, for reasons I cannot debug, you want track my bits and bytes, you can trace me back to the Twitters of the interwebs at [@seanballais](https://www.twitter.com/seanballais). If tracing, I mean, tweeting ain’t your thing, you can still reach me via my [email]({{site.url}}/contact/). You can also ask me questions via [Ask.fm](https://ask.fm/sfballais123). For those people who would like to view my online portfolio, it’s hosted in [Coderbits](http://www.coderbits.com/sfballais123).
