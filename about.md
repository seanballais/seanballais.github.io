Hi! I’m Sean. I primarily write code in Python and HTML5/CSS3. Okay, I know this is too short for an *About page*. So, I will elaborate more.

First of all, my full name is Sean Francis N. Ballais. My friends usually call me ‘Sean.’ I went out of my mother’s womb on May 15, 1999, and I currently reside in Tacloban City, Philippines (Yes, the one that was [hit by Super Typhoon Haiyan](/blog/remembering-haiyan/) way back in November 8, 2013). I currently study in University of the Philippines Visayas Tacloban College majoring in B.S. Computer Science.

As mentioned before, I am a coder, better known as a (hobbyist) programmer. My forte is Python, and I have working knowledge with HTML5 and CSS3. I also have experience with C, Java, and PHP as those were the languages used in our classes during high school and recently, college. C++ used to be my go-to language until I discovered Python.

I have dabbled with Ruby, Perl, C#, Visual Basic, Node.JS, and Go before. However, I do not consider myself capable of building applications using any of the said languages as I have only experimented with them for a short amount of time.

As with many other programmers, I am also political in terms of operating system preference. Honestly, [I prefer working with a UNIX-based system](/blog/why-linux/), most notably Linux or OS X, than working with a Windows machine. Windows just doesn’t give me enough power and flexibility in my opinion. It was a different case way back around early 2011 that I find programming in Windows easier and more preferable. I also advocate the use of open source technologies, because open source is amazing.

Whenever I’m not coding, I would sometimes be seen playing sports and hanging out with friends; reading books or online articles of any topic that may interests me (IFLS, CommitStrip, Phoronix, PCWorld, YCombinator News, and Reddit, anyone?); creating art with GIMP, and/or Blender 3D; listening to podcasts; taking pictures; blogging; keeping up with the latest news; ‘hacking’ technology; or just pondering ideas for the future.
