                    <p>Susi is an open-source file encryption tool that encrypts using AES-GCM-256 to a custom file format, SSEF, to protect files from unauthorized access. This was also built to help me improve my programming skills. Susi is built with Rust, C#, and C++. An installer for the app was already created using InnoSetup.</p>

                    <p>Pira Pasahe is a commuter companion app that allows users to know the correct fare to pay tricycles when commuting in Tacloban City currently only available for Android. This was built as a response to tricycle drivers of the city asking for fares higher than the regulated fare price, which is a regular problem among commuters of the city. Almost released the app to the Google Play Store, but app performance is not satisfactory, so release is indefinitely postponed until the app is of satisfactory quality. This project is currently built with Flutter.</p>

                    <p>Botos is an open-source election system built in Python for use in schools. It includes features such as allowing voters to vote for multiple candidates running for one position, and allowing admins to view the current election results. It has been used in the Philippine Science High School - Eastern Visayas Campus and St. Therese Educational Foundation of Tacloban Inc.. I am no longer actively maintaining this, but I do some maintenance-related work when needed.</p>

                    <p>Building Placement Tool is an app I developed as part of my undergraduate thesis, "Solving the Classical Unequal Area Static Facility Layout Problem Using a Modified Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm". In line with the goals of my thesis, the app tries to find a good arrangement for a set of buildings within a certain quadrilateral lot using a stochastic optimization algorithm. In the app's case, it utilizes a modified grey wolf optimization algorithm. A modified genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization were also implemented as points of comparison against our modified grey wolf optimization algorithm. I built this app using a custom game engine. Overall, this was built using C++, CMake, Conan, Dear ImGui, SDL 2, and EASTL.</p>
