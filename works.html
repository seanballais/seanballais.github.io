                    <p>Pira Pasahe is a commuter companion app that allows users to know the correct fare to pay tricycles when commuting in Tacloban City currently only available for Android. This was built as a response to tricycle drivers of the city asking for fares higher than the regulated fare price, which is a regular problem among commuters of the city. Almost released the app to the Google Play Store, but app performance is not satisfactory, so release is indefinitely postponed until the app is of satisfactory quality. This project is currently built with Flutter.</p>

It has been used in the Philippine Science High School - Eastern Visayas Campus and St. Therese Educational Foundation of Tacloban Inc.. I am no longer actively maintaining this, but I do some maintenance-related work when needed. End date indicates the last time I worked on Botos.</p>

                    <p>Building Placement Tool is an app I developed as part of my undergraduate thesis, "Solving the Classical Unequal Area Static Facility Layout Problem Using a Modified Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm". In line with the goals of my thesis, the app tries to find a good arrangement for a set of buildings within a certain quadrilateral lot using a stochastic optimization algorithm. In the app's case, it utilizes a modified grey wolf optimization algorithm. A modified genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization were also implemented as points of comparison against our modified grey wolf optimization algorithm. I built this app using a custom game engine. Overall, this was built using C++, CMake, Conan, Dear ImGui, SDL 2, and EASTL.</p>

The project was built using C++ and SFML. Unfortunately, the code, as it is written currently, can only be run in Linux.</p>

                    <p>CopyOver is an app that I built to let users sync the clipboards of their computers and mobile devices, similar to Apple's Universal Clipboard, through the MQTT protocol. The target platforms were Windows, Linux, and Android. Some basic functionality, such as copying between two computers and between a computer a laptop, were accomplished. However, technical limitations discouraged me from further working on the project. The project was built using C++, Kotlin, and Qt. The latest attempt (around late February to early March 2024) to work on the project used C# and WinUI 3 for the Windows app for a more native experience.</p>

                    <p>Push 'Em Over is a student game project we created back in college. It's a two-player game where the goal is to push the other player to a spike or off the map to get a point. The first player to get a certain number of points wins. The map is also procedurally-generated, so each match will have different map layouts. Basic controller, albeit now bugger, support is also in the game to control one of the players. The game also came with sound effects and background music, but we used copyrighted music from Move or Die for the background music, so the audio in the demo above is silenced. This game was built using Java and libGDX.</p>
