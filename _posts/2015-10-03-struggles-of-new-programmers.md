*Author's Message (October 3, 2015): I'm sorry that I wasn't able to write new articles from mid-August to late September. I just entered my first year in college. I have been very busy since then. School work, extra-curricular activities, Math 17, and life (and love life? Haha.) made me busy. I promise to do my best to write articles every month. And this article is dedicated to my classmates. Hi, Komsai Pamily! :) -Sean*

I'm now two months into my BS Computer Science degree in the University of the Philippines Visayas Tacloban College. All is well for me. I find all the CS lab exercises fun and challenging. Unfortunately, many of my fellow classmates seem to struggle in many of the lab exercises. They remind me of the early days I started to learn programming.

One fact that many people don't realize is that programming, in the general sense, is not an easy job to do. It may look easy on the outside, but in the inside, it's actually full of abstractions and logic. To get some sense of the difficulty of programming, try describing every single step of a opening a door. By **every single step**, I mean every single step including the intensity of how long each hand muscle must be contracted or relaxed.

Programming is tough. But it's actually a fun thing to do. It can both makes you feel smart, and dumb at the same time. To summarize, programming is like love. It sometimes makes you happy. It sometimes hurts you. The start is usually the toughest part but it'll be worth it in the end.

Many of my classmates think I'm great at programming. I think otherwise. I know that my classmates are all smart. Many are even better at Math than I am. Many wonder how I became this *"great"* as a programmer. Yet, many haven't realized yet the struggles I had when I was still starting out in this adventure.

I started programming when I was 11, but the interest started when I was 7. I first started with making game quizzes using Microsoft PowerPoint. I then gradually wondered how computer programs play music. Prior to that, I started using computers when I was 2. I still remember playing a multiplayer match of the original Half-Life when I was around 4 and was constantly losing to the AI. Come on, I was 4, Okay?
