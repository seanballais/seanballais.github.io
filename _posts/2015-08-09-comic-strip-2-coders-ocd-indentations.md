Another comic strip for you guys. I'm sure many programmers can relate to this.

*In case you're wondering, I used [Atom](http://www.atom.io) as the text editor in the comic strip.*

*Do check out [CommitStrip](http://www.commitstrip.com), the website that inspired me to create the strip. They have excellent and hilarious strips that, as they say in their site, relate to the lives of web agency developers.*

*What's your habit when indenting code? Are you in the four spaces camp or the two spaces camp? Let me know in the comments below.*
