*Do check out [CommitStrip](http://www.commitstrip.com), the website that inspired me to create the strip. They have excellent and hilarious strips that, as they say in their site, relate to the lives of web agency developers.*

*How is your Valentine's Day going? Still single? Let us know in the comments below.*
