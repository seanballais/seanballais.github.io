*Do check out [CommitStrip](http://www.commitstrip.com), the website that inspired me to create the strip. They have excellent and hilarious strips that, as they say in their site, relate to the lives of web agency developers.*

*What software projects have you worked on that doesn't have tests? How was the experience? Let me know in the comments below.*
