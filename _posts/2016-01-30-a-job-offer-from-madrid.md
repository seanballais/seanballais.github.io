On January 15, 2016, a peculiar email dropped in my inbox. I received a message from a Developer Relations Engineer in source{d}, a company based in Madrid, Spain (I did not mention his name for his safety). The subject line read, "Senior Python Engineer at KnC." With my interest piqued, I read the email. Seconds later, I was jumping in joy (figuratively).

I was offered a job as a Senior Python Developer! A chance to be a professional. Surprisingly, the job would be in Sweden. Admittedly, I am quite a fan of the aforementioned country. It is the motherland of Felix Kjellberg (yes, I am a bro), Notch (the creator of Minecraft), and Roomie (a singer). My inner fan boy was screaming in joy.

A job in Sweden is also an opportunity for me to experience winter. I have been living in the Philippines all my life where we only have two seasons - wet and dry. The closest cold season I could experience is when I went to Japan in early November 2014 to present a research paper. The season was already autumn so the scenery was a beautiful thing to look at.

However, I rejected the offer.

I have reasons why I rejected the offer.
