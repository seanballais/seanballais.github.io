With the recent release of Windows 10, many of my friends have upgraded to the new version and posted their updates on Facebook. I could feel their excitement. What's my reaction to the release? Well, it's better expressed through the comic strip below.

*This is the first of many comic strips that I'll be posting in my blog. I'm not good at drawing comics, so excuse the art quality.*

*Do check out [CommitStrip](http://www.commitstrip.com), the website that inspired me to create the strip. They have excellent and hilarious strips that, as they say in their site, relate to the lives of web agency developers.*

*What was your reaction when Windows 10 was released? Let me know in the comments below.*
