Recently, I have read that the university I am currently studying in, University of the Philippines (UP), will slowly be shifting to use a new system called eUP that provides university functionalities such as student enrollment, and data management.

This shift made me curious about the website. So, I checked out the website. The homepage seems to load fast.
