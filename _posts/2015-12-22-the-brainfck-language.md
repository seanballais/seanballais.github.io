Today, I came across this forum post over at [Daniweb](https://www.daniweb.com/hardware-and-software/linux-and-unix/threads/501073/why-linux).

As seen from the photo, it's just basically asking the question, "Why Linux?". This piqued my interest in answering the question for I have been a Linux user since 2012, specifically through [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com).

I would have answered immediately the forum post but I decided to turn my answer into this blog post. I believe I would be able to answer it better through this post.

Let's start. But first, a little bit of history.

### A Little Bit of History

I first used Linux way back around 2008 because of shee curiosity. Our old desktop computer has Ubuntu installed together with Windows. The interface was still full of orange colors. All I did with Ubuntu at that time was play the preinstalled games and nothing more.

A few years later, I began my first foray into installing Ubuntu into our old desktop computer. That's when I began my transition into a Linux user.

Since that time, I've slowly learned the ins and outs of Linux, its beauty and frustrations, and many more. And this time, I only have Linux installed in my laptop. No dual-boot. No Windows. You could say that [I'm a Linux fan](/blog/comic-strip-1-i-will-always-love-you-linux/).

### Okay, so why Linux?

Oh simple answer. Linux gives me all the tools and power I need to develop software.

Even though I have spent a large chunk of my early programming days in Windows, I began learning programming in Linux. The operating system I used to start learning programming was in Linux through [BASIC-256](http://www.basic256.org). Ahh, good times.

Even though the transition from Windows to Linux was a bit rough, it became easier once I learned how to use GCC. Code::Blocks helped my transition a lot.
