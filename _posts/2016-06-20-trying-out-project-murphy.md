description: "Playing with Microsoft's new bot, Project Murphy. And it's lots of fun."

My current Skype Web session does not have a 'Discover Bots' button, neither does my Skype client does (thanks for being ignorant to [Linux](http://www.seanballais.com/blog/why-linux/), Microsoft.). So, I searched for a solution. As I was looking for a solution to my dilemma, I stumbled upon Project Murphy, one of Microsoft's recent AI bot projects.

[Project Murphy](https://www.projectmurphy.net) is an experiment by Microsoft that creates imaginative images based on your what-if questions using machine learning techniques. You can rate the image it makes if it did a good job or not. You can even ask for more images based on the same what-if question.

Project Murphy was conceived to showcase the new technologies in [Microsoft's Cortana Intelligence Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/cortana-intelligence-suite). It was released initially on Skype on March 31, 2016 and was introduced at Microsoft's Build 2016 developer conference. It was built by the same team who developed [How-Old.net](http://www.how-old.net/).

At the time of writing, you may contact Murphy through Skype, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram. Support for kik, and Slack (a non-functional Slack integration is already available from the website) is coming soon.

Previously on March 23, 2016, Microsoft showed off Tay, an AI that tweets like a teen, to Twitter. It [did not go as planned](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist)...[twice](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/30/tay-microsofts-ai-program-is-back-online.html). Tay was immediately turned offline and Microsoft said that they will only reactivate the bot once it "becomes safer."

To give you a feel for Murphy, here are some of the images he made from my questions.

Ever wondered if Drake dances ballet? Yeah, me too. This is what Murphy has got to say.

I am a bit disappointed with the duck version of PewDiePie by Murphy.

Look at the lovely new couple combined. New Swift song, anyone?

Trying out Murphy is fun even though it is not perfect. Trust me, it can get quite a bit addicting. I highly recommend you try it out whenever you can.

Artificial intelligence is improving every single day. It is here to stay. Project Murphy is just one of the vast applications of AI. Cool new things utilizing artificial intelligence are coming out everyday. I wonder what the tech industry will surprise us next.
